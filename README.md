# ViSNet: a scalable and accurate geometric deep learning potential for molecular dynamics simulation

## Overview

[ViSNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.16518.pdf) (shorted for “**V**ector-**S**calar **i**nteractive graph neural **Net**work”) is a scalable and accurate graph deep learning potential for molecular dynamics that significantly alleviate the dilemma between computational costs and sufficient utilization of geometric information.
